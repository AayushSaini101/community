## Overview

In the [search for the right governance model](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/governance-motivation) we ended up defining Technical Steering Committee (TSC) that can help making decisions that are related to entire AsyncAPI Initiative and not only specific repository. TSC voting is described in official [Charter](https://github.com/asyncapi/community/blob/master/CHARTER.md#4-tsc-voting).

To make voting process easier with proper automation we use [**git-vote**](https://github.com/cncf/gitvote) bot.
### Voting Rules

* The voting will be done by only TSC Members.
* The duration of the voting will be 2 minutes. 
* The vote will be passed when more than 50% voting are in favour.

### How to vote on particular issue and pull request.

You need to add only one command to start the voting process on the issue on in the particular PR. **Please not only TSC Members can participate in the voting process**.

*A **vote label** will be added on the issue after starting of the voting process.*

**Command:**

```
/vote
```
